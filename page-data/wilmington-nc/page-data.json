This is a 13% increase from 2019 to 2020 and an almost 20% increase from 2018 to 2020. That money could be better spent on supporting affordable housing, educational opportunities, health care, and community outreach programs that are more successful at promoting safe and stable communities than law enforcement has been. I demand that more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas.\n\nI am demanding long-term, sustainable change. I am demanding that the city of Wilmingtonâ€™s budget be better spent on quality of life for all, particularly for those in our Black and Brown communities, who are more than likely to be directly affected by police brutality and violence. I also urge the Wilmington City Council to enact legislation that holds police accountable and to overturn policies that allow police to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity.\n\nPeople are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to listen to the needs of Wilmington residents and take immediate action to address their concerns. Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Wilmington","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"NC","permalink":"/wilmington-nc","recipients":["bill.saffo@wilmingtonnc.gov","council@wilmingtonnc.gov","margaret.haynes@wilmingtonnc.gov","neil.anderson@wilmingtonnc.gov","clifford.barnett@wilmingtonnc.gov","charlie.rivenbark@wilmingtonnc.gov","kevin.spears@wilmingtonnc.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
