This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Our county has been at the forefront of much of this action.\n\nThe brutal, senseless, and violent murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers derelict in their duties to protect and serve is deeply disturbing. We, as a nation, are in need of a drastic overhaul in policing. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the budget for the MPD to programs and city-led initiatives that support education, rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that must be achieved.\n\nMontgomery County's Police is not exempt from racial issues. We see story after story of Black people being harassed, searched and arrested for simply being Black.\n\nHow many of you have been arrested for helping a drunk neighbor home?\nWhat about standing outside of a McDonalds?\nWhat about walking down the street?\nWill Jawando himself was stopped for driving while Black. If even elected officials are not safe from this treatment, how can the average person have any sense of safety and trust in the police?\n\nThis is not acceptable behavior for people expected to uphold the law and keep all members of the community safe. There are consequences to actions. Even if you wear a badge.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Montgomery County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the County Executive and Council","state":"MD","permalink":"/montgomery-county","recipients":["marc.elrich@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Katz@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Hucker@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.albornoz@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Friedson@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Glass@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.jawando@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Navarro@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Rice@montgomerycountymd.gov","councilmember.Riemer@montgomerycountymd.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
