I am a resident of [YOUR CITY, STATE] and I am emailing today to demand the defunding of the Minneapolis Police Department and the funding of new, community-led and integrated health and safety strategies.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic, racist violence which has been, to this point, overseen by the Minneapolis City Council. George Floyd was murdered during this oversight. Beloved Minneapolis institutions were burned and destroyed in the aftermath. People have been left without the resources they need. Jobs and livelihoods will take a long time to recover. And most of all, Black citizens of Minneapolis continue in this moment to live in a city that is currently upholding the Minneapolis Police Department which has brutalized and taken too many Black lives. Therefore, we will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of reform. \n\nWe need to defund the Minneapolis Police Department. We need a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of Minneapolis residents during the pandemic and well past it; and we need a budget that supports communities and supports their well-being. \n\nI am urging you and the Minneapolis City Council to adopt a budget that defunds the police and funds non-violent, community-led, health and safety strategies.\n\nSincerely,\\\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":["kevin.reich@minneapolismn.gov","cam.gordon@minneapolismn.gov","steve.fletcher@minneapolismn.gov","phillipe.cunningham@minneapolismn.gov","jeremiah.ellison@minneapolismn.gov","abdi.warsame@minneapolismn.gov","lisa.goodman@minneapolismn.gov","andrea.jenkins@minneapolismn.gov","alondra.cano@minneapolismn.gov","lisa.bender@minneapolismn.gov","jeremy.schroeder@minneapolismn.gov","andrew.johnson@minneapolismn.gov","linea.palmisano@minneapolismn.gov"],"city":"Minneapolis","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"MN","permalink":"/minneapolis","recipients":["jacob.frey@minneapolismn.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
