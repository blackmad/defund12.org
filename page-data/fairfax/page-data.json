This past week, our nation has  been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.\nFCPD has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the Police Department cost the county $176 424,490. While we've been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.\nI call on you to slash the FCPD budget and instead use those extraordinary resources towards  funding what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief,  housing, healthcare, treatment, healing, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects. This re-allocation of funds to community based programs are proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community.\nWe can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.\nSincerely,\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Fairfax County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Legislature","state":"VA","permalink":"/fairfax","recipients":["braddock@fairfaxcounty.gov","Jim.Shelton@fairfaxcounty.gov","chairman@fairfaxcounty.gov","mason@fairfaxcounty.gov","Dranesville@FairfaxCounty.gov","huntermill@fairfaxcounty.gov","IPAPoliceAuditor@fairfaxcounty.gov","LeeDist@fairfaxcounty.gov","mtvernon@fairfaxcounty.gov","provdist@fairfaxcounty.gov","springfield@fairfaxcounty.gov","sully@fairfaxcounty.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
