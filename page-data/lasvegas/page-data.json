I am writing to demand that Mayor Carolyn Goodman and City Council to do everything in their power to adopt a budget that prioritizes our community well being and redirects funding away from the police in the next budget evaluation period.\n\nWe have seen mounting evidence that police departments are racist and ineffective institutions that put citizens at risk of injury and death, yet the police budget accounts for 13% of our general fund.\n\nI ask that you redirect the majority of the $174M allotted for crime prevention towards community programs that provide citizens with basic human needs like affordable healthcare, housing, and education. With nearly 35% of our residents currently unemployed, we need funding to address the needs of people hurting from the effects of COVID 19, people experiencing homelessness, and the marginalized communities in our city.\n\nSocial programs and education have been shown to be far more effective than policing at promoting community safety and equity.\n\nOur community is in pain along with the nation. We desperately need a reevaluation of the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Las Vegas","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and Council Members","state":"NV","permalink":"/lasvegas","recipients":["cgoodman@lasvegasnevada.gov","officeofthemayor@lasvegasnevada.gov","gameling@lasvegasnevada.gov","ward1@lasvegasnevada.gov","ward2@lasvegasnevada.gov","ward3@lasvegasnevada.gov","ward4newsletter@lasvegasnevada.gov","ccrear@lasvegasnevada.gov","mfiore@lasvegasnevada.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
