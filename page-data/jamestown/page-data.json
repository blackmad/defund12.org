I am writing to demand that Jamestown Town Council adopt a town budget that prioritizes community welfare and redirects funding away from police.\n\nThis fiscal year the town plans to give just over 1.8 million to our police system, a substantial 15.5% of the budget. Community development interests--including libraries, parks, recreation, and public health--by contrast make up only 9% of the budget in total. Out of the community development interests only 31,000 dollars is allocated to Public Health services(0.2% of the budget), and no money is allocated to affordable housing.\n\nI demand that Town Council begin defunding Jamestown Police, and re-allocate those funds to community programs that could truly help the Jamestown community, like community based mental health services, affordable housing, and other improved social services. I demand a budget reflecting what the community of Jamestown needs.\n\nThe Jamestown community needs to take part in meaningful change. We may be small, but we must consider the message that our community sends when it does not take part in considering our role in perpetuating systems of harm instead of providing for those most in need.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Address]\n[Your Phone Number]","cc":null,"city":"Jamestown","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and Town Council","state":"RI","permalink":"/jamestown","recipients":["billpiva8@cox.net","mgblanco@cox.net","meagherjamestowntc@gmail.com","jtownelc@aol.com","Major510@cox.net"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
