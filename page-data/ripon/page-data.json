Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2019-2020 is poorly allocated. I am emailing you to demand an ethical and equal reallocation of the Ripon expense budget away from Ripon Police Department and towards the community center, parks, and the library.\n\nRedirect money away from the police department and into these programs that will benefit public health and the community. The budget for 2019-2020 suggests that the largest fraction of the city's budget should go to policing ($6,557,258) whereas the budget for the community center is a mere $98,971.\n\nIf this is truly representative of the council's thoughts on how funds should be allocated, I am ashamed to call Ripon my home, and I am ashamed to call you my elected officials.\n\nTransitioning funding away from policing and into community programming such as educational opportunities, arts programs, community centers, healthcare, and mental health resources will strengthen our communities and make them safer for everyone. When every person has the resources they need to be healthy and safe, our community can thrive. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating this funding!\n\nWe can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Ripon","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/ripon","recipients":["jparks@cityofripon.org","ddegraaf@cityofripon.org","uecker105@yahoo.com","mrestuccia@cityofripon.org","leo.zuber@yahoo.com","kwerner@cityofripon.org","jkilgore@cityofripon.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
