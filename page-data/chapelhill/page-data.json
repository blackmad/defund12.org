In light of the continued devaluation of Black life in this country, I am disappointed to see that my town plans to increase the police budget in the coming year.\n\nWe have reached a turning point, here in Chapel Hill and around the country. We may choose to divert funds from an increasingly militarized police force and invest in community education, health, and employment. Or we may increase already sizable budgets and escalate the terror Black Americans face on our streets. I hope you all will choose the former.\n\nPlease do not increase the police budget in FY2020-21.\n\nThank you,\n\n[x]\n","cc":null,"city":"Chapel Hill","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"NC","permalink":"/chapelhill","recipients":["mayorandcouncil@townofchapelhill.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
