I am writing to demand that funding is reallocated from the ELPD to social and public programs in our community. It is an outrage that 32% of city funding goes towards the Police Department while public works and cultural investment is less than 10% of the city budget. The ELPD has seen a number of high profile abuse and violence claims recently and the budget should reflect that poor performance.\n\nI write to demand that the City Council defund the East Lansing Police Department. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I am demanding a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted East Lansing residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. A budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers police should be your number one priority.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the proposed East Lansing city budget for FY2021. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"East Lansing","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"MI","permalink":"/eastlansing","recipients":["rbeier@cityofeastlansing.com","astephens@cityofeastlansing.com","lbabcock@cityofeastlansing.com","jgregg@cityofeastlansing.com","mmeadows@cityofeastlansing.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
