I am writing to demand that the Middlesex County adopt a budget that prioritizes community wellbeing, and redirects funding away from the police system, as it disproportionately violates the rights and lives of Black community members - like Qwason Campbell who was assaulted by Woodbridge PD on June 1.\n\nI demand that the Middlesex County Representatives begin meaningfully defunding all New Jersey Police Departments and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Central New Jersey residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Middlesex County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Representatives","state":"NJ","permalink":"/middlesexcounty","recipients":["laura.cartwright@mail.house.gov","NJ12BWIMA@mail.house.gov","senbateman@njleg.org","asmfreiman@njleg.org","asmzwicker@njleg.org","senthompson@njleg.org","asmclifton@njleg.org","asmdancer@njleg.org","sengreenstein@njleg.org","asmbenson@njleg.org","asmdeangelo@njleg.org","senbsmith@njleg.org","asmdanielsen@njleg.org","AsmEgan@njleg.org","sendiegnan@njleg.org","asmkarabinchak@njleg.org","aswpinkin@njleg.org","senvitale@njleg.org","AsmCoughlin@njleg.org","aswlopez@njleg.org","senscutari@njleg.org","aswcarter@njleg.org","asmkennedy@njleg.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
