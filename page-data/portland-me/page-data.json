I ask you to refuse to increase the budget for PPD and rather reallocate funding for PPD to organizations for essential human services including education, social services, housing, job creation. \n\nWith the economic impact that COVID-19 has had on Portlandâ€™s economy, difficult and thoughtful decisions will be required regarding the budget for Portland for 2021. Residents of Portland are experiencing homelessness, illness, unemployment, loss of income, and police brutality in record numbers. The people that have bear the brunt of this are People of Color, Indigenous peoples, the poor, and the working class.\n\nData shows that Black people are disproportionately more likely to be policed, arrested, and incarcerated than white people in Portland. This proves that systemic racism is present here in Portland and is perpetuated by the Portland Police Department. Defunding the police will be the first step towards improving the quality of living for Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) that are residents of Portland. It will divert funds from going to an institutionally racist association and allow those funds to be diverted to human services that need them badly.\n\nPlease do the right thing. Prioritize the health, safety and well-being of Portland residents.\n\nREFUSE TO FUND THE PORTLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Portland","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"ME","permalink":"/portland-me","recipients":["ksnyder@portlandmaine.gov","bsr@portlandmaine.gov","sthibodeau@portlandmaine.gov","tchong@portlandmaine.gov","jcosta@portlandmaine.gov","kcook@portlandmaine.gov","pali@portlandmaine.gov","jduson@portlandmaine.gov","nmm@portlandmaine.gov","fclark@portlandmaine.org","Richard.Farnsworth@legislature.maine.gov","pali@portlandmaine.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
