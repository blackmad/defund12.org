I am writing to demand that the governments of Wilmington adopt budgets for the people--that prioritize community well-being and redirect funding away from the police.\n\nOur country is in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. As a resident of Wilmington, I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.”\n\nSupport for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. The City Council must defund the police department, which consumes more of the city's finances than health, housing, and parks combined. The county must do the same, with new castle police representing by far the largest county expenditure. This city needs a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted Wilmington residents during this trying and uncertain time--a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowering the police forces that tear them apart. Our militarized police should not be responsible for responding to the vast majority of community problems. Further, social programs and education have long been shown to be much more effective than policing at promoting safe and equitable communities.\n\nAs our local representatives, the budgets that most directly impact our lives are in your hands. It is your duty to represent the residents of Wilmington. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund care, not cops. You must adopt a budget for the people. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Wilmington","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City & State Officials","state":"DE","permalink":"/wilmington","recipients":["mspurzycki@WilmingtonDE.gov","jcarney@state.de.us","MMeyer@nccde.org","jtogden@WilmingtonDE.gov","dsophrin@WilmingtonDE.gov","mgjopson@WilmingtonDE.gov","alance@WilmingtonDE.gov","karen.hartley-nagle@newcastlede.gov","kenneth.woods@newcastlede.gov","dee.durham@newcastlede.gov","janet.kilpatrick@newcastlede.gov","penrose.hollins@newcastlede.gov","elisa.diller@newcastlede.gov","david.carter@newcastlede.gov","george.smiley@newcastlede.gov","john.cartier@newcastlede.gov","timothy.sheldon@newcastlede.gov","jea.street@newcastlede.gov","david.tackett@newcastlede.gov","james.bell@newcastlede.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
