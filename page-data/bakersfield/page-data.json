We demand reallocation of funding from BPD to social and public programming that takes place in our communities. It is an outrage that nearly a quarter of the city funding for 2021 is planned towards the Police Department, including Police Chief Terryâ€™s exorbitant salary. \n\nWe demand that the City Council defund the BPD by joining similar calls across the country. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Bakersfield residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.\n\nIt is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the Bakersfield city budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund Care Not Cops. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Bakersfield","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and Council Members","state":"CA","permalink":"/bakersfield","recipients":["Mayor@bakersfieldcity.us","City_Council@bakersfieldcity.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
