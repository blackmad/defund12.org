I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a People’s Budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing, embodied by the SLCPD’s well documented history of murdering Black people. We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.\n\nSupport for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. But instead, the Mayor has proposed an increase in funding to the SLCPD, despite the fact that crime has fallen considerably during the past few months. The SLCPD has seen a rise in overtime pay which, more often than not, is paid out to officers responsible for harassing the unhoused, and Black, Indigenous, people of color.\n\nWe demand that the City Council defund the SLCPD. We join the calls of those across the country to #DefundThePolice. We demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of at-risk Utahans during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. We demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.\n\nAlthough City Council has avoided voting or revising Mayor Mendenhall’s draconian budget proposal, the document is back in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the SLC budget for 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund #CareNotCops. You need to adopt a People’s Budget. Public opinion is with me.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"Salt Lake City","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Council Members and Mayor","state":"UT","permalink":"/saltlakecity","recipients":["mayor@slcgov.com","james.rogers@slcgov.com","andrew.johnston@slcgov.com","chris.wharton@slcgov.com","ana.valdemoros@slcgov.com","darin.mano@slcgov.com","dan.dugan@slcgov.com","amy.fowler@slcgov.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
