I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community wellbeing and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. This, combined with a global pandemic with severe economic consequences, brings the issue of police budgeting to the forefront.\n\nThe 2019-20 Upland budget called for 54% of its General Fund Expenditure ($22.6 million of $41.9 million) to go towards the Upland Police Department, an even larger proportion than cities like Oakland (41%) and Houston (32%). Furthermore, the majority of the 460K increase to the maintenance and operations budget belonged to the police, even as communities have become safer in Upland and nationwide.\n\nI demand the Upland City Council meaningfully defund Upland PD. I join the calls of those across the country demanding a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of its citizens during this trying and uncertain time.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE]\n[YOUR EMAIL]","cc":null,"city":"Upland","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/upland","recipients":["dstone@ci.upland.ca.us","jelliott@ci.upland.ca.us","zuniga@ci.upland.ca.us","bvelto@ci.upland.ca.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
