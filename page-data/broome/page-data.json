I am asking the County Legislature to begin meaningfully defunding the Broome County Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Broome County residents. Much scholarship shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of police department funds towards healthcare and social programs.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Broome County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Legislators","state":"NY","permalink":"/broome","recipients":["stephen.flagg@broomecounty.us","scott.baker@broomecounty.us","kelly.wildoner@broomecounty.us","kim.myers@BroomeCounty.US","daniel.j.reynolds@broomecounty.us","greg.baldwin@broomecounty.us","matthew.pasquale@broomecounty.us","jason.shaw@broomecounty.us","matt.hilderbrant@broomecounty.us","cindy.obrien@broomecounty.us","susan.ryan@broomecounty.us","rick.balles@broomecounty.us","bob.weslar@broomecounty.us","mary.kaminsky@broomecounty.us","mark.whalen@broomecounty.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
