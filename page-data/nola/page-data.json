I am a New Orleans resident writing to urge you to defund the New Orleans Police Department.\n\nI am contacting you to demand a significant reduction to the $194 million that is currently allocated to public safety in the upcoming fiscal budget of 2021 and for a formal review of the New Orleans Police Department Union Contract from an independent party that has no affiliation with NOPD. The police funds make up roughly 20% of the budget, while other important public services do not receive even half as much funding. By reducing police funding and reducing incarceration rates, those funds can be reallocated to housing, education or sanitation, among other needs. That way we can focus on building our community efforts and local organizations, while preventing future police brutality and violence.\n\nAs New Orleans residents, we therefore demand that you take immediate action towards the following ends:\n* Reduce NOPDâ€™s allocation from the General Fund\n* Discontinue use of General Fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence\n* Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.\n* New Orleans can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund NOPD.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"New Orleans","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor, City Council and Police Chief","state":"LA","permalink":"/nola","recipients":["mayor@nola.gov","jarwilliams@nola.gov","helena.moreno@nola.gov","joseph.giarrusso@nola.gov","jay.h.banks@nola.gov","kristin.palmer@nola.gov","jcbrossett@nola.gov","cyndi.nguyen@nola.gov","nopdchief@nola.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
