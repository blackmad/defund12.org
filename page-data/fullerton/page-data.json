I am writing to demand that the Fullerton City Council adopts a budget that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.\n\nAccording to the Fullerton city website, the proposed budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year allocates 47% of the general fund ($49,860,929) to the Fullerton Police Force. Meanwhile, Community Development only comprises 5% of the general fund and 3.5% of all funds and expenses. While the budget allocates extraordinary amounts to policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Fullerton does not have a crime problem, Fullerton has a social problem. I am demanding you completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year to fund care, not cops.\n\nI insist that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Fullerton Police Department and re-allocate funds to social programs long proven to be more effective than policing at promoting community safety and equity. Specifically, we are looking to bolster our existing child and family, housing and neighborhood, food, health, homeless, training, employment and financial services. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Fullerton residents.\n\nHistory has shown that police “reform” is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and in fact actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of police in our city.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"Fullerton","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/fullerton","recipients":["jenniferf@cityoffullerton.com","jflory@cityoffullerton.com","jesuss@cityoffullerton.com","bwwhitaker@live.com","ahmadz@cityoffullerton.com","evaa@cityoffullerton.com"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
