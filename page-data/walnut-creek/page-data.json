This percentage has risen for the last two decades and takes away desperately needed resources from essential city programs and services. The entire budget for Community & Economic Development only accounts for 8% ($14.9M) of the city's budget. Increased police spending shows no correlation to increasing public safety over the past 20 years, thus our city's investment in policing has not made us safer – WCPD remains an embarrassment to the city and a lethal threat to Walnut Creek's Black and Brown communities.  With Walnut Creek's current finances in dire jeopardy, it is clear that we must defund the police.\n\nAs a Walnut Creek resident, I therefore demand that you take immediate action to ensure the following:\n\n* Reduce WCPD’s allocation from the General Fund by 50% (roughly $26M).\n\n* Disallow unauthorised overtime by WCPD.\n\n* Discontinue use of general fund dollars to pay for settlements due to police murder, misconduct, and negligence.\n\n* Invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe.\n\nWalnut Creek can not wait any longer for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to Defund and Abolish WCPD.\n\nThank you,\n\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Walnut Creek","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Haskew and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/walnut-creek","recipients":["justin@justinwedel.com","kwilk@walnut-creek.org","cindy@cindysilva.org","francois@walnut-creek.org","mayor@walnut-creek.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
