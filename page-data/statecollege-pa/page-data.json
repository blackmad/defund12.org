I am writing to ask you to defund the State College Police department.\n\nIn 2019 Osaze Osagie was murdered by a State College Police Officer. Osaze's murder was deemed \"justified\" by the DA, but no citizen should be killed by their city. This use of public funds to kill is unacceptable.\n\nAccording to the 2020 budget, police represent by far the largest of all city general fund expenditures. At 38.3%, this over shadows every other public project. The funding used on the police department must be reallocated to useful social programs which help people, such as Osaze who was in a state of mental distress, rather than on the use of force to end lives. We must invest in housing, jobs, youth programs, restorative justice, and mental health workers to keep the community safe\n\nState College can not wait for a budget that meets the needs of its residents. The only way to achieve this is to take immediate steps to defund the State College Police Department.\n\nSincerely,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"State College","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Council Members and Mayor","state":"PA","permalink":"/statecollege-pa","recipients":["mayor@statecollegepa.us","boro@statecollegepa.us","jbarlow@statecollegepa.us","dbehring@statecollegepa.us","jengeman@statecollegepa.us","pmarshall@statecollegepa.us","tlafer@statecollegepa.us","emyers@statecollegepa.us","dmurphy@statecollegepa.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
