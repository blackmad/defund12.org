I am asking you to redirect money away from the Columbia PD and into the public services such as housing, education, and healthcare access, and to consider direct financial relief to citizens (not just businesses) impacted by COVID-19. \n\nAs it stands, our city is facing massive revenue shortfalls due to conditions created by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Rather than see further reduction to public services and layoffs of essential public workers, I request that the mayor and city council first and foremost consider significantly defunding the police department. In the FY21 budget, there was an increase to both police personnel and corrections spending. This money can be spent in other ways that are proven to be more effective in improving community safety and wellness. \n\nThank you for your time, \n\n[YOUR NAME] \n\n[YOUR ADDRESS] \n\n[YOUR EMAIL] \n\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Columbia","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to City Council & Mayor","state":"MO","permalink":"/columbiamo","recipients":["ward6@CoMo.gov","mayor@CoMo.gov","ward2@CoMo.gov","ward3@CoMo.gov","ward4@CoMo.gov","ward5@CoMo.gov","ward1@CoMo.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
