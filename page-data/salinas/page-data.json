As the nation mourns the loss of not only George Floyd, but the deaths of countless people of color at the hands of local law enforcement, now more than ever, we need to support our children and families.\n\nOur local police department is set to receive an increase of $447,026 for 2020-2021 in their budget which is already nearly half of our entire general fund (45%). At the same time, our Library and Community Services Department is projected to lose $326,000 of their funding having only received 8% of our budget as it were.\n\nThis is unacceptable. The youngest members of our community deserve access to clean parks, online learning spaces and library resources, and to continue to have access to the quality sports, arts, and cultural programming taking place in our recreation centers. Furthermore, we need to fund mental health professionals, crisis de-escalators, and other resources for those suffering from domestic abuse and addiction, who are too often subjected to unjust policing.\n\nPlease take action to make the necessary investments for the future of our community. \n\nSincerely,\n[Resident Name, District (optional)]","cc":null,"city":"Salinas","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor Gunter and Council Members","state":"CA","permalink":"/salinas","recipients":["cityclerkwebmail@ci.salinas.ca.us","salinasmayor@ci.salinas.ca.us","district1@ci.salinas.ca.us","district2@ci.salinas.ca.us","district4@ci.salinas.ca.us","district5@ci.salinas.ca.us","district6@ci.salinas.ca.us","district3@ci.salinas.ca.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
