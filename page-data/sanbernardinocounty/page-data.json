I am writing to you today to demand that San Bernardino County join others across the U.S. in defunding the police.\n\nThe Inland Empire and San Bernardino County spend an egregious amount of money on policing, and it's time that we reallocate that money back into our communities. According to the 2019-2020 Adopted Budget, Law and Justice was allocated $1,068,878,347. In contrast, the Community Development and Housing Agency, which covers homeless services, affordable housing assistance, community development, and infrastructure improvements, was given $63,159,085. Economic Development, which includes workforce development, resources for job seekers, vocational training, supportive services, and small business assistance, got only $30,513,332.\n\nFor decades, we've witnessed police terrorizing our neighborhoods, rather than lending a hand. We've also witnessed our cities taking years to assist impacted and marginalized residents, to fix roads, and to address the critical needs of community members. I urge you to listen to your constituents and prioritize our basic needs like housing, healthcare, education, economic assistance, and emergency relief. It is your duty to represent us.\n\nThank you for your time,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"San Bernardino County","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to County Officials","state":"CA","permalink":"/sanbernardinocounty","recipients":["SupervisorLovingood@sbcounty.gov","assemblymember.obernolte@assembly.ca.gov","SupervisorRutherford@sbcounty.gov","Supervisor.Rowe@bos.sbcounty.gov","supervisor.hagman@bos.sbcounty.gov","supervisorgonzales@sbcounty.gov","dwert@sbcounty.gov","COB@sbcounty.gov","da@sbcda.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
