Mayor Kenneyâ€™s proposed Philadelphia budget for fiscal year 2021 has proposed a $14 million increase for the Philadelphia police department during a time of economic strife and while other essential social budgets that support the community are being slashed. For example, budgets for library, homeless services, Parks and Recreation, and public health (during the global COVID-19 pandemic!) are all being cut and the city is eliminating its budget for arts and culture entirely. \n\nI urge you to advocate for an ethical reallocation of funds: away from PPD, and towards social services and education programs. \n\nI am emailing to ask city officials to please reject any proposed budget that increases taxpayer spending on police while cutting funding for important social and community projects. I am asking that city officials lobby the same amount of attention and effort towards finding sustainable, long term change. \n\nBlack Lives Matter. \nSincerely, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]\n","cc":null,"city":"Philadelphia","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Council Members","state":"PA","permalink":"/philly","recipients":["Kenyatta.Johnson@Phila.gov","Joshu.Harris@Phila.gov","Brett.Nedelkoff@phila.gov","Helen.Gym@phila.gov","Shanee.Garner@Phila.gov","Jamie.Gauthier@phila.gov","Max.Weiss@Phila.gov","Maria.Q.Sanchez@phila.gov","Eric.Bodzin@Phila.gov","Derek.Green@phila.gov","Frank.Iannuzzi@Phila.gov","Duwayne.Terry@Phila.gov","Curtis.Jones.Jr@phila.gov","Samantha.Williams@Phila.gov","bobby@bobbyhenon.com","Bobby.Henon@Phila.gov","Lauren.Atwell@phila.gov","Katherine.Gilmore.Richardson@phila.gov","Shawn.Baldwin@Phila.gov","Allan.Domb@Phila.gov","Eryn.Santamoor@Phila.Gov","Laurel.Grbach@phila.gov","Cherelle.Parker@Phila.gov","Rachel.Meadows@Phila.gov","Isaiah.Thomas@phila.gov","Daniel.Lodise@Phila.gov","David.Maynard@phila.gov","Darrell.Clarke@phila.gov","Jessica.Sanchez@Phila.gov","Mary.McDaniel@Phila.gov","David.Oh@Phila.gov","Tyler.DeBusi@Phila.gov","Brian.ONeill@phila.gov","Robert.Yerkov@Phila.gov","Mark.Squilla@Phila.gov","Sean.Mcmonagle@phila.gov","Cindy.Bass@Phila.gov","Rodnie.jamison@phila.gov","Kendra.Brooks@phila.gov","Alison.Stohr@phila.gov","James.kenney@phila.gov","brian.abernathy@phila.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
