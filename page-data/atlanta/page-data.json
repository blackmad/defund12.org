I am asking to redirect money away from the Atlanta PD and into the following social services: [LIST - Community Development, COVID Relief, Education, Parks & Recreation, targeted support for marginalized communities]. \n\nI have noticed that in the 2021 budget proposal, from the general fund, the police department is receiving a 5.90% increase from 2020. Meanwhile, many other services are receiving cuts to their budgets. In light of recent events, I believe it is critical that policing be deprioritized relative to spending on social programs that are actually proven to promote safe and equitable communities.\n\nI request that an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayor's proposed budget and reallocate these funds to resources the citizens can benefit from.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Atlanta","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Atlanta Financial Division","state":"GA","permalink":"/atlanta","recipients":["cebell@atlantaga.gov","sagabriel@atlantaga.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
