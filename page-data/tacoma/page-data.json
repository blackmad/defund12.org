I am writing to demand justice for Manuel Ellis, an innocent Black man who was murdered by Tacoma police officers on March 3, and so many murdered Black people before him.\n\nDespite autopsy evidence ruling Ellis’ death a homicide, the officers involved in this murder have not been charged and are still employed at the Tacoma Police Department. This is unacceptable. Administrative leave is not enough. I demand that these officers be fired and arrested for their crimes.\n\nI am also asking the City of Tacoma to show your commitment to racial justice moving forward by opposing any increase in the Tacoma Police Department’s budget, and re-allocating city resources from policing to services that keep Black people safe, such as healthcare, education, and community programs. \n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Tacoma","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Demand Justice for Manuel Ellis and Defund Tacoma PD","state":"WA","permalink":"/tacoma","recipients":["victoria.woodards@cityoftacoma.org","john.hines@cityoftacoma.org","robert.thoms@cityoftacoma.org","catherine.ushka@cityoftacoma.org","chris.beale@cityoftacoma.org","lillian.hunter@cityoftacoma.org","conor.mccarthy@cityoftacoma.org","kristina.walker@cityoftacoma.org","keith.blocker@cityoftacoma.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
