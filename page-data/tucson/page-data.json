I am urging you to divest from the criminalization of our communities and reduce police spending in the budget for the 2021 fiscal year. In May, Mayor Romero warned of deep spending cuts due to the pandemic. It is time to cut funding for the Tucson Police Department.\n\nIn the previous budget, police received $193,274,430, more than Parks and Recreation ($53,126,400) and Housing and Community Development ($89,091,600). Continuous budget cuts in Education slash essential after-school and enrichment programs, and large cuts in Parks and Rec over the years force a shortage of hours of recreation centers and special events.\n\nI know many of you feel strongly about racial justice and equity. Mayor Romero claims to have a commitment to the people of Tucson, and, on June 2, claimed that the police require \"systemic reform and meaningful policy change.\" Your words are meaningless unless you use your power to take action on that.\n\nIndividual solutions will not fix systemic problems. It is time for Tucson, its leaders, and residents to create a more equitable city for all of us. Have the moral clarity to reallocate a budget to focus on communities. Defund the Tucson Police Department.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Tucson","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor, Council, and City Manager","state":"AZ","permalink":"/tucson","recipients":["Ward1@tucsonaz.gov","Ward2@tucsonaz.gov","Ward3@tucsonaz.gov","Ward4@tucsonaz.gov","Ward5@tucsonaz.gov","Ward6@tucsonaz.gov","citymanager@tucsonaz.gov","Mayor.Romero@tucsonaz.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
