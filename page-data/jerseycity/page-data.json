While I applaud Mayor Fulop’s commitment to the Obama Foundation pledge to review and reform police use of force policies, I don’t believe this is enough. Police reforms do not necessarily eliminate police violence: the Minneapolis Police Department had already implemented many reforms, and George Floyd was still murdered. I urge that you take radical steps to defund the police and move towards the goal of reimagining public safety without a police department.\n\nJersey City’s proposed 2020 Municipal Budget has $111,390,803 allocated to the Division of Police. This is by far the largest fraction of the city’s budget, and is nearly 50% higher than the second largest allocation of funds (Division of Fire’s $76,744,661). It’s an egregious statistic compared to $41,306,177 proposed for the entire Department of Public Works; $8,569,377 for the Department of Housing, Economic Development & Commerce; and $5,282,056 for the Department of Health & Human Services. The allocation for the police alone takes up nearly 20% of the entire $612 million budget.\n\nI am writing to demand that the 2020-2021 Jersey City municipal budget be revised to reallocate funds away from police and towards things like education, healthcare infrastructure (including non-coercive mental healthcare), youth programming, and non-coercive drug and alcohol treatment programming.\n\nMayor Fulop and city councilors, please consider making these changes that are in the best interest of our community now and for the future.\n\nThank you,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR PHONE]\n[YOUR EMAIL]","cc":null,"city":"Jersey City","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"NJ","permalink":"/jerseycity","recipients":["info@stevenfulop.com","Fulops@jcnj.org","jwatterman@jcnj.org","RLavarro@jcnj.org","DRivera@jcnj.org","DRidley@jcnj.org","MPrinz-Arey@jcnj.org","RBoggiano@jcnj.org","YSaleh@jcnj.org","JSolomon@jcnj.org","JDRobinson@jcnj.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
