This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful reevaluation of the role of policing in our communities and an end to racism and anti-Blackness. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.\n\nRPD has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the RPD budget was $74,990,406, the majority of which comes from the Richmond general fund. While weâ€™ve been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.\n\nI call on you to meaningfully restrict the RPD budget and instead use those extraordinary resources towards solving homelessness, which is felt most by our Black neighbors and veterans. Social programs and education generally have been shown to be much more effective at promoting safety and social equity than policing and incarceration.\n\nWe can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change. Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social service programs?\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Richmond","country":null,"date":"2020-06-06T13:38:00.000Z","name":"Letter to Richmond Officials","state":"CA","permalink":"/richmondca","recipients":["TOM.BUTT@intres.com","Belinda_Brown@ci.richmond.ca.us","natbates@comcast.net","eduardo_martinez@ci.richmond.ca.us","trina_jackson@ci.richmond.ca.us","jael_myrick@ci.richmond.ca.us","ben_choi@ci.richmond.ca.us","melvin_willis@ci.richmond.ca.us","demnlus_johnson@ci.richmond.ca.us","CPRC@ci.richmond.ca.us"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
