The two year budget for the Sheriffâ€™s Office for the 2020-2021 fiscal year is $96,307,964. This is a 6% increase in the budget from the FY2018-2019 budget. The largest budget enhancement of the 2020-2021 budget is the addition of fourteen deputies in 2020 and fourteen deputies in 2021- eight more total than the Sheriff requested. The 2020 Greenville city budget allocated fully 1/3 of the general fund to policing, vastly more than any social services. \n\nResearch shows that social spending--on housing, education, health--is much more effective at promoting safe communities than policing. An armed response to every problem in our community is inappropriate and puts residents in danger.\n\nI am requesting that budget votes be delayed and an emergency meeting be called before the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny/revise the proposed budgets.\n\nI am demanding long term and sustainable change. I am demanding that the budgets for Greenville city and county be better spent on quality of life for all. In particular for those in our Black and Brown communities, who are more than likely to be directly affected by police brutality and violence. Programs that support education, housing, healthcare, and community centers deserve our prioritization.\n\nThank you,\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]","cc":null,"city":"Greenville","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to the Mayor, City Council, and County Council","state":"SC","permalink":"/greenville","recipients":["rmccaskill@greenvillecounty.org","kwhite@greenvillesc.gov","mefird@greenvillesc.gov","jdeworken@greenvillesc.gov","lflemming@greenvillesc.gov","kgibson@greenvillesc.gov","wbrasington@greenvillesc.gov","ddowe@greenvillesc.gov","rstall@greenvillesc.gov","jdill@greenvillecounty.org","xnorris@greenvillecounty.org","mbarnes@greenvillecounty.org","lseman@greenvillecounty.org","wmeadows@greenvillecounty.org","efant@greenvillecounty.org","scates@greenvillecounty.org","lballard@greenvillecounty.org","rroberts@greenvillecounty.org","bkirven@greenvillecounty.org","btaylor@greenvillcounty.org","dtripp@greenvillecounty.org"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
