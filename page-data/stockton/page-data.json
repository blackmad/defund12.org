I am writing to demand that the City Council adopts a budget for the people that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police, including the proposed police funding increase of $3,311,169 in the upcoming year.\n\nWe are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. Empty gestures and suggestions of “reform” are at this point unacceptable. I am demanding that our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.\n\nSupport for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. We demand that the City Council defund the SPD. I join the calls of those across the country to meaningfully reduce funding to the police department. I demand a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of impacted Stockton residents during this trying and uncertain time, when livelihoods are on the line. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowering the police forces that tear us apart.\n\nAs the City Council, the budget proposal is in your hands. It is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, and to fund people, not police. We must take immediate action on this issue.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\\[YOUR NAME\\]\n\\[YOUR ADDRESS\\]\n\\[YOUR EMAIL\\]\n\\[YOUR PHONE NUMBER\\]","cc":null,"city":"Stockton","country":null,"date":null,"name":"Letter to Mayor and City Council","state":"CA","permalink":"/stockton","recipients":["mayor@stocktonca.gov","dist1@stocktonca.gov","dist2@stocktonca.gov","dist3@stocktonca.gov","dist4@stocktonca.gov","dist5@stocktonca.gov","dist6@stocktonca.gov","florence.low@stocktonca.gov"]}},"siteConfig":{"title":"Defund12.org","meta":"Email government officials and council members to reallocate police budgets towards education, social services, and dismantling racial injustice.","logoUrl":"/images/defund12.org.png","faviconUrl":"/favicon.svg","autoOpenMessage":"This page automatically opens a drafted email for you.","badMailtoMessage":"Email link not working correctly?
