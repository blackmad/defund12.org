body: "My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a resident
  of the [DISTRICT NUMBER] district. I am writing you to demand the restructuring of
  the Philadelphia city budget in a way that prioritizes social services for communities
  and drastically minimizes spending on police. \n\nWe are in the midst of widespread
  upheaval over the systemic violence of policing, embodied by the PPD's well documented
  history of disproportionately enacting violence against Black communities. We will
  no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” We are demanding that
  our voices be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates
  its resources.\n\nThe proposed $14 million budget increase for PPD is unacceptable
  and comes at the cost of affordable housing, support for essential city workers,
  and other transformative initiatives. These programs are needed now more than ever
  to alleviate the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for Black and Brown
  communities. I ask that the mayor, city managing director, and city council members
  prove their love and dedication to the people of this city and reallocate funds
  to directly benefit those in need."
