body: "Hi, my name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I am asking to
  redirect money away from the Atlanta PD and into the following social services:
  [Where you would like to see police budget redirected, like Community Development, COVID Relief, Education, Parks & Recreation, targeted
  support for marginalized communities]. \n\nI have noticed that in the 2021 budget
  proposal, from the general fund, the police department is receiving a 5.90% increase
  from 2020. Meanwhile, many other services are receiving cuts to their budgets. In
  light of recent events, I believe it is critical that policing be deprioritized
  relative to spending on social programs that are actually proven to promote safe
  and equitable communities.\n\nI request that an emergency meeting be called before
  the fiscal year goes into effect in order to deny the mayor's proposed budget and
  reallocate these funds to resources the citizens can benefit from."
